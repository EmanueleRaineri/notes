* Intro

The delta method is a trick by which one can calculate mean and variance of
a function of a random variable (see eg \cite{wasserman2013all} for a rigorous definition).
It works by writing the Taylor expansion of the function (say $g(X)$) around
$E[X]=\mu$.  

To compute the mean of $g(X)$ one does 
\[ E[g(X)] \approx E[g(\mu)+g^{\prime}(\mu)(X-\mu)] = g(\mu) \].  
For the variance one has
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var[g(X)] = E[(g(X)-E[g(X)])^2] & \approx &  E[(g(X)-g(\mu))^2]\\
= E[(g(\mu)+g^{\prime}(X-\mu)-g(\mu))^2] &  =  & (g^{\prime}(\mu))^2E[(X-\mu)^2] \\
& = & (g^{\prime}(\mu))^2\mbox{Var}[X]  
\end{eqnarray*}

* Example: arcin transform of binomial random variable

Let's consider $Y \sim \mbox{Binomial}(N, \mu)$; hence $E[Y]=\mu$ and $\mbox{Var}[Y]=N\mu(1-\mu)$.
We also consider the transformed variable $Z=g(Y)=\arcsin(2Y/N-1)$.
Using the delta method as in the formulae above one has
 
$E[Z] \approx \arcsin (2\mu-1)$. For the variance,
$g^{\prime}(\mu)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(2\mu-1)^2}}$ hence
\[\mbox{Var}[Z] \approx 4 \frac{1}{N^2(1-(2\mu-1)^2)} \mu(1-\mu) = \frac{1}{N}\]\label{deltavar}

$\mbox{Var}[Z]$ does not depend on $\mu$ hence $\arcsin$ is said to stabilize the
variance of $Y$ (this is a known result, \cite{YU20091621}). 

We can plot \ref{deltavar} against the variance of $Z$ computed 
using the definition:

\[\mbox{Var}[Z]=\sum_{i=0}^n (Z_i-E[Z])^2 P(Z_i)\]\label{exvar}

where $Z_i=g(i)$ and $P(Z_i)=P(Y=i)=\mbox{Binomial}(i|N, \mu)$, and
\[E[Z]= \sum_{i=0}^n Z_i P(Z_i)\].

The agreement between the variance computed with the delta method as in \ref{deltavar}
end the exact variance can be seen in the figure below:
